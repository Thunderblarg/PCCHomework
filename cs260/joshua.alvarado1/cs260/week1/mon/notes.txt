makefile is a collection of rules.
eachrule looks like this:

target: dependency list
    command line (preceded by a tab

When building your code:
stage 1: compile individual .cpp
	hello.cpp -> hello.o
	source file -> object code
stage 2: link the object code
	hello.o linked with library code
	hello.o and library -> main (or whatever you want to call it)
	link object code into binary executable

use explicit rules vs implicit rules for makefile
