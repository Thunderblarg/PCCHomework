      # Function: write_int
      # -------------------
      # Writes the integer value in %rdi to the standard output.
      #
      # This function converts the integer to its ASCII string representation
      # and outputs it using the sys_write system call.
      #
      # Inputs:
      #   %rdi - The integer to be printed.
      #
      # Registers used (clobbered):
      #   %rax, %rbx, %rcx, %rdx, %rsi, %r8
      #
      # Stack layout:
      #   Uses a local buffer of 32 bytes on the stack to store the string.
      #
      # Notes:
      #   - The function handles negative integers, including INT_MIN (-2^63),
      #     which cannot be negated in two's complement representation.
      #   - The integer is converted to a string by repeatedly dividing by 10
      #     and storing the digits in reverse order in the buffer.
